## Usage

### Step 1: Fetch Market Data
Use the provided modules to fetch historical or live market data:
- For stock data:
  ```python
  from data_fetchers import StockDataFetcher

  stock_data = StockDataFetcher.fetch('AAPL', start_date='2020-01-01', end_date='2023-01-01')
  print(stock_data.head())
  ```

- For cryptocurrency data:
  ```python
  from data_fetchers import CryptoDataFetcher

  crypto_data = CryptoDataFetcher.fetch('BTC/USDT', exchange='binance', timeframe='1d')
  print(crypto_data.head())
  ```

### Step 2: Develop a Strategy
Implement your trading strategy using the `backtrader` framework. Example template:
```python
import backtrader as bt

class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = bt.ind.SMA(period=20)

    def next(self):
        if self.data.close[0] > self.sma[0]:
            self.buy()
        elif self.data.close[0] < self.sma[0]:
            self.sell()
```

### Step 3: Backtest Your Strategy
Run a backtest using your strategy:
```python
from backtest import Backtester

backtester = Backtester(strategy=MyStrategy, data=stock_data)
results = backtester.run()
backtester.plot()
```

### Step 4: Deploy Live (Coming Soon)
Modules for live trading integration with brokers and exchanges are under development.
